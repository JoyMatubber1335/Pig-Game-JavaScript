# Pig-Game-JavaScript 

In this ping pong game, there are three buttons: New Game, Roll Dice, and Hold. This game is also played by two players.
New Dice: When I click this button, it starts a new game and sets all values to zero.
Roll Dice: When clicking this button, the die shows us a number between 1 and 6. If the number equals 1,
then the position changes to another player, and the score is set to zero. otherwise, 
add the number to the current score until you click the hold button.
Hold Button: If you click the Hold button, all current results will be added to the final result and your position will be switched to another player.Â
