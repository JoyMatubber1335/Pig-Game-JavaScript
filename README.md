Pig Game:
This is a simple game where two players take turns rolling a dice. Each player's score is the sum of all the dice rolls they have made during their turn.
If a player rolls a 1, their score for that turn is reset to 0 and it becomes the other player's turn. 
The first player to reach a score of 100 or more wins the game.

How to Play:

If you roll a 1, your score for that turn is reset to 0 and it becomes the other player's turn.
If you roll any other number, that number is added to your score for the turn.
Click the "Hold" button to add your current turn score to your total score and end your turn.
